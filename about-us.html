						<p>The Informatics Department at the University at Albany, College of Computing and Information is committed to providing students with real-world, hands-on problems. Teams of students from INF 362: Intermediate Interactive Design used their technology, problem solving and people skills to work on projects like the one you are using here. All Informatics students have opportunities to work on projects like this in classes, as internships, or through community-service projects. <a class="aboutLink" href="www.albany.edu/informatics/" target="_blank">www.albany.edu/informatics/</a> </p>

						<p>Albany Law School is a small, independent private school located in the heart of New York state’s capital since 1851. As the oldest law school in New York and the oldest independent law school in the nation, the institution offers students an innovative, rigorous curriculum taught by a committed faculty. Several nationally recognized programs—including the Government Law Center and the Albany Law Clinic & Justice Center—provide opportunities for students to apply classroom learning to real situations. Students have access to New York's highest court, federal courts, the executive branch and the state legislature. With approximately 10,000 alumni practicing in nearly every state in the country, and several continents, Albany Law’s graduates serve as a vital community and resource for the law school and its students.<a class="aboutLink" href="www.albanylaw.edu" target="_blank">www.albanylaw.edu</a></p>

						<p>designHaus is a group of five individual upperclass SUNY Albany students who, through taking a course together, discovered a chance to make something truly special. As a good amount of designHaus members live off campus, the idea to make a tenant's guide strongly resonated with the team. The chance to make a website that would be used to help others is something that designHaus is immensely proud of. designHaus members have many varied talents pulled from years of class experience at SUNY Albany, and this website is a testament to the team's abilities. We hope that this website serves as a resourceful tool for any issues an individual may encounter in the renting process, and as an example of what this team has to offer in web services.
